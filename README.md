Bombyx3D Build System
=====================

Building
--------

You will need the following software to build this tool:

  * [Java SE Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) (version 8 or later)
  * [Apache ANT](http://ant.apache.org/)

Invoke `ant` in the root directory of the project. It will compile the sources and create file `bin/buildsystem.jar`.

It is also recommended to run tests after compilation. This can be achieved by invoking the `ant run-tests` command
in the root directory of the project.

Also, projects files for [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) are included.
